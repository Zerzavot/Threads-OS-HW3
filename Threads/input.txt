Thread management:
Routines that work directly on threads - creating, detaching, joining, etc.
They also include functions to set/query thread attributes such as joinable, scheduling etc.

Mutexes:
Routines that deal with synchronization, called a "mutex", which is an abbreviation for "mutual exclusion". Mutex 
functions provide for creating, destroying, locking and unlocking mutexes.
These are supplemented by mutex attribute functions that set or modify attributes associated with mutexes. 

Condition variables:
Routines that address communications between threads that share a mutex. Based 
upon programmer specified conditions. This group includes functions to create, destroy, wait and signal based upon specified variable 
values. Functions to set/query condition variable attributes are also included.

Synchronization:
Routines that manage read/write locks and barriers.
